Vampire Survivors meets tower defense! A work-in-progress Survivor-like co-op base defense game.

## Summary

The game is basically Vampire Survivors meets tower defense. You have a central base to protect in the middle of a fairly small map. You have a character who can move freely around. The character automatically deploys weapons. Some of these are centered around the character, similar to weapons in Vampire Survivors. However, some of the weapons are deployments, meaning things like turrets that are placed on the ground and have their own automatic attacks.

Monsters slowly move towards the center. When they reach the center, they will do some damage before they are likely killed by the base's weapons.

Gameplay is cooperative. People will go around together to make sure susceptible areas around the base are covered by appropriate weaponry. Difficulty scales based on time, number of players, their average level, etc.
